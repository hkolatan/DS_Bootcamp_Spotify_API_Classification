# Exploring Music Classification with Spotify API


## Overview

This project aims to classify music genres using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the genre of a given music track based on its audio features. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Spotify API, which provides a wide range of audio features for each track.

The project is divided into the following main steps:
1. Data Collection: Retrieving audio features and track information using the Spotify API and storing them in a SQL database.
2. Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships of the audio features.
3. Model Building: Creating and training machine learning models to classify music genres based on the audio features.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using various metrics.
5. Web Application: Creating a Streamlit web application to interactively predict the genre of a user-provided music track.
